### To add website link

A simple, fun, and interactive website for toddlers and kids! As they press keys on the keyboard, letters, numbers, and symbols appear on the screen in random font sizes and colors. This project was inspired by my nephew and niece, Alexandr and Kyrina, who seem to be really interested in my keyboard whenever they come by.
